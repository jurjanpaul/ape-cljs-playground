*Away from Preferred Editor ClojureScript Playground*

Write and evaluate ClojureScript in your mobile device's browser.
Code is stored in your browser's localStorage. Parentheses are kept balanced by Parinfer.

Powered by the amazing [Scittle](https://babashka.org/scittle/) (as well as Reagent and CodeMirror), all you really
need is [index.html](https://github.com/jurjanpaul/ape-cljs-playground/blob/main/index.html)
(which includes some documentation as inline comment). Small exception: I forked and tweaked the [parinfer-codemirror.js](https://github.com/shaunlebron/parinfer-codemirror) dependency to slightly improve scrolling behaviour.

Host it yourself or simply use https://jurjanpaul.github.io/ape-cljs-playground.
